# DMS

Welcome to DMS, a safety and accountability mobile application. DMS is a dead man switch that allows you to set regular alarms and receive notifications whenever an alarm is visited. The user must dismiss the notification, or else DMS will notify emergency contacts with a message and alert them to possible problems.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for the application derived from our team members' travels. We all had experienced sketchy, and sometimes even outright dangerous situations in the past when we were out of state or country. In situations like thos, we needed a safeguard to ensure that we would have friends and family watching out for us and receiving regular updates so that they wouldn't have to worry about our safety. And thus, DMS was born.

## Features

- Alarms set in regular hourly, daily, or weekly intervals
- Custom alarm start times with minute-precision

## Implementation Details

### Front-end

We used React Native with the Expo API on the front-end. This allowed us to be cross-compatible with a simple but sleek interface designed for quick and easy usage.
